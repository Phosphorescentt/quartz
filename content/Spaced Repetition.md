I would love to meaningfully integrate spaced repetition into my daily workflows. Reflecting on my bachelors degree in mathematics, the reason I struggled so much is because I rarely took the time to internalise definitions and I focussed too much on intuitive understanding. This meant that I understood concepts well, but communicating them with other mathematicians (particularly those that were marking my papers) proved quite difficult. Hopefully I can find something that will make my life easy in this department, but we will see.
