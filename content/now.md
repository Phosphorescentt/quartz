I'm currently FTE employed at a financial services company in central London writing *mostly* serverless Python.

In my free time, there are a number of projects brewing:
- This website
- [AIrena](https://github.com/Phosphorescentt/airena)
- [mdpm](https://github.com/Phosphorescentt/mdpm)
- [monopoly-simulator](https://github.com/Phosphorescentt/monopoly-simulation)
- Figuring out how to be who I am.
