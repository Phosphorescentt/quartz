Some days I'm hit with a spike of motivation and I think "Damn there are so many things that I want to do to be more me" and these initial thoughts are destroyed with the following thought: "Which one is the *most important* one to start with?".

Ah, a dependency problem - time to pull out some graph theory. Long story short, the idea is to construct a matrix of each habit and which other habits it enables and use that to decide on some [topological sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) for the habits to tell me which one(s) I should pick up first.

Results for this idea are pending, but I reckon I can hack something together in an afternoon.
