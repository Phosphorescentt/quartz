Hi there! I'm Phos, a 23 year old, London-based software engineer with a background in mathematics. I mostly write Python, but I am trying my hardest to learn Rust (with variable results). I am obsessed with doing great work and I have a lot of strong opinions about achieving great work in environments that tend to actively infringe on that goal.

On the weekends you can probably catch me playing Celeste, Factorio or enjoying London's *incredible* underground music scene.
